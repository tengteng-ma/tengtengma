### Graph Neural Network Model with Attention Mechanism for Customer Engagement Prediction

<font size=4 color=gray>with Yuheng Hu, Yingda Lu, Siddhartha Bhattacharyya</font>

We design a Graph Neural Network model called GACE to predict customer engagement of brand posts by exploiting large-scale content consumption information from the perspective of heterogeneous network.

### Modeling Customer Complain Behavior: A Neural Matrix Factorization Approach

<font size=4 color=gray>with Yuheng Hu, Yingda Lu</font>

We propose a deep learning approach which incorporates prior domain knowledge into a principled probabilistic matrix factorization framework to enhance complain behavior predictions as well as their interpretability.

### Virtual Humans in Health-Related Interventions: A Meta-Analysis
<font size=4 color=gray>with Debaleena Chattopadhyay, Hasti Sharifi</font>

We systematically evaluate evidence from controlled studies of interventions using virtual humans on their effectiveness in health-related outcomes. The design and implementation characteristics of these systems are also examined.
